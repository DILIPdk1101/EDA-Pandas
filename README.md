# World Population Analysis

This repository contains the Python code and analysis report which involves analyzing a world population dataset to understand the global population distribution and growth trends.

# Project Overview:

The project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization task that includes the following components:

1.Data Analysis and Visualization

2.Interpretation and Insights

3.Visual Appearance

# Analysis Details:

1. Data Collection and Preparation
   
The world population data from world_population.csv was (Source:kaggle) read into a pandas DataFrame.
Unnecessary columns were removed for a focused analysis.

2. Data Cleaning
   
Missing values were identified and handled by dropping rows with any missing values.
The data was formatted to display floats with two decimal places.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
Displayed basic information and summary statistics of the dataset.
Checked for missing values and the number of unique values in each column.
Calculated the correlation matrix for numeric columns.

4. Data Aggregation and Grouping
   
Grouped data by continent and computed the mean population for each year.
Transposed the grouped data for better visualization.

# Visualizations and Interpretations:

1. Frequency Table and Bar Plot
   
Displayed the top 10 countries by world population percentage in 2022.
Bar plot of the top 10 most populous countries in 2022.

2. Boxplot

Boxplot showing the distribution of population data over the years.

3. Line Plot
 
Line plot showing the average population growth by continent from 1970 to 2022.

4. Pie Chart
   
Pie chart depicting the population distribution by continent in 2022.

5. Choropleth Map
    
Interactive choropleth map showing population density by country in 2022 using Plotly.

# Conclusion

Our detailed analysis offers valuable insights into the patterns and trends in global population data. By understanding these patterns, policymakers and researchers can better strategize to address global demographic challenges and opportunities.
